# RNN Architectures Implementation

This project implements four types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using TensorFlow:

1. Standard LSTM RNN
2. Multiplicative LSTM RNN
3. Standard GRU RNN
4. Multiplicative GRU RNN

Each architecture follows a set of model equations specific to its respective gating mechanism.

### Task Overview

To showcase the differences in the performance of these architectures, the Copy Task is used. Each model is trained and tested on sequences of randomly generated characters with varying lengths: {100, 200, 500, 1000}.

### Results & Analysis

For detailed implementation, training, testing, and analysis, please refer to the Jupyter notebook `Assignment_3_Maxim_Ryabinov.ipynb`. The notebook contains step-by-step breakdowns of the code and an analysis of the performance metrics collected through training and testing (last section of the notebook at the very bottom).
